This script pulled the addresses for all Planned Parenthood locations from their website and added it them to a csv file.  Each state has a page that lists addresses, so the script had to iterate through 50 URLs.  The problem here is that the Planned Parenthood site does not like these kinds of data requests â€“ the try-loop in the pploc function gets around this by tricking the site into thinking the code is a human making individual requests.
