The problem was that several of the quantitative fields, and different fields in each layer, were coded as text strings.  The code iterates through all 19 layers in the geodatabase.  For each layer, it adds new long fields to replace the older string fields, calculates the new long fields from the old string fields by iterating through both field lists simultaneously, and then deletes the old string fields.  Each layer has 60+ fields and in total there are 2.5 million observations.  The script took 26 hours to execute!
